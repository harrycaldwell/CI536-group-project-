        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Malware is a disease that harms users on the internet every single day, and the reason why Cyber Security
            is so important. It harms not only our devices and data but can pose serious threats to our physical and
            mental wellbeing. This course will help equip you with the knowledge necessary to feel confident and aware
            of malware on the internet.</p>

            <h2>Types of Malware</h2>
            <p>As defined by the NCSC, Malware is malicious software which if able to run can cause harm in many ways
                such
                as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Locking or making a device unusable.</li>
                <li>Accessing or deleting data.</li>
                <li>Gaining control of your device.</li>
                <li>Obtaining sensitive and private credentials.</li>
                <li>Using services that may cost you money.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3><u>Viruses</u></h3>
        <p>A computer virus is a type of malware that spreads by infecting a file or system
            and then copying itself onto it. Viruses can be programmed to do anything, which
            might include deliberately damaging files or just spreading to as many victims as
            possible. Viruses require a user to activate it, by pressing on a link for example.</p>
        <h3><u>Worms</u></h3>
        <p>Worms are a type of virus which spread without the need of a human interaction.
            They often take up valuable memory and bandwidth space which causes the computer
            to stop responding.</p>
        <h3><u>Trojan Horse</u></h3>
        <p>A trojan horse is a malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program. Often
            this is used in conjunction with social engineering where an attacker tricks a
            victim to do something which appears safe but contains malicious software.</p>
        <h3><u>Ransomware</u></h3>
        <p>As the name suggests this type of malware hijacks the computer and stops the
            user from getting it. Ransomware also can capture and encrypt/steal and delete
            data which is important to a user or company. The attackers will then use this as
            leverage and ransom it back for large sums of money.</p>

        <p>A famous and recent example of this is when the British Library was attacked in 2023.
            The attackers stole around 600GB of data and ordered a ransom of £600,000. The impact of
            this attack however is thought to have cost the library over £7m and said to have long lasting effects.

        <h2>How Malware Spreads</h2>
        <p>Phishing attacks is the most common way malware spreads where attackers send out hundreds of fake emails
            and entice uses to open them. Social engineering is also a common method where attackers trick a user into
            clicking or downloading something harmful.</p>
        <h2>Protection and Prevention</h2>
        <p>Anti-virus software is a very effective way of preventing viruses and other malicious software.
            A VPN(Virtual Private Network) can be used to encrypt and keep your data hidden when online.
            One of the most important steps to take is to ensure all your software and operating systems
            are up to date. As time goes on, more vulnerabilities are discovered and thee updates from
            companies fix and patch these issues. Cyber security is a constant battle and a user must be up to date to
            be mot safe
